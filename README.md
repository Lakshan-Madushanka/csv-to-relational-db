# Insert large volume of csv data set into relational db

## Technologies
*Laravel (Queue, Events), Angular*

## Real world scenario

There are couple of situations I had to use this kind of solution. One of them is when we develop a new system 
(web based) for a company to automate their business, most of the time old system records are stored in excel sheets
so we have to insert the all of them into relational db. So this project is a good guide to get understanding 
how we do it with the power of laravel queue system.
